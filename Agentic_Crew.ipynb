In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.

We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i. 3.2 Attention An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

In the Bahdanau attention mechanism, the keys and values are the same vector.\\n But if we have thought for example the first row of the score matrix as:\\n[ word1/word1 word1/word2 word1/word3 word1/word4 ]\\nthen the elements of the attention vector (a row of the attention matrix) might be interpreted as somewhat a coded version of the row of the score matrix since in the product between two matrix we do rows*columns product.\\n In the latter case, if I get, for example, word 3, then the first element of the corresponding attention vector (row) is related to the first word, the second element to the second, and the third element to the fourth word ?.\\n Note\\xa0that Bahdanau et al.’s attention mechanism is divided into the step-by-step computations of the alignment scores, the weights, and the context vector:\\n$$e_{t,i} = a(\\\\mathbf{s}_{t-1}, \\\\mathbf{h}_i)$$\\n$$\\\\alpha_{t,i} = \\\\text{softmax}(e_{t,i})$$\\n$$\\\\mathbf{c}_t = \\\\sum_{i=1}^T \\\\alpha_{t,i} \\\\mathbf{h}_i$$\\nBahdanau et al. implemented an RNN for both the encoder and decoder.\\n The idea behind the attention mechanism was to permit the decoder to utilize the most relevant parts of the input sequence in a flexible manner, by a weighted combination of all the encoded input vectors, with the most relevant vectors being attributed the highest weights.\\n'},\n",

      "The attention mechanism is a key component of deep learning models, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision tasks. It allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input data that are relevant to the task at hand, rather than treating all parts of the input equally.\n",
